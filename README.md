# HomeValues_CrimeStats_Python_Data_Science_Project

This was the first project I used Python for data wrangling and analysis. 

Housing data pulled from Zillow and crime data from the FBI. My goal was to find what types of crime are the best predictors of home values. I also analyzed home value and crime rate trends to attempt to suggest some of the best places to live in the country for both safety and investment reasons.
